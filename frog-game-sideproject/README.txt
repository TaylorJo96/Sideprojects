Hello! thanks for checking out my project! I'm super
proud of this project as it is my very first project I have done completely on my own.
I had a ton of fun animating the characters, figuring out how to get my picture boxes to do the things i
wanted them to do, and really just getting familiar with c#. hope you enjoy!
